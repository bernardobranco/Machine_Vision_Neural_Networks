mlp.m - Implementation of multilayer perceptron

pratical10a.m - Training of a small multilayer perceptron to classify some toy data points in a 2D-space.

pratical10b.m - Using a 7-layer autoencoder (with pre-trained weights) to generate images that look like numbers by generating
random latent codes from a 500D standard Gaussian and passing these vectors through the decoder. The task is to find the subspace of the latent code, such that one can smoothly interpolate between numbers in latent space.
